            <p>When creating a new product or service the most important thing is to determine, who am I serving?</p>
            <p>Who will be affected or impacted by my product?</p>
            <p>Who is going to pay me for my work? What type of work are they willing to pay for?</p>
            <p>Who is the beneficiary, is it the same person who is paying, or is it someone else?</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>To answer these questions, we're working from the EcoSystem in towards our target customers. 
            People have been very generous with their time and insights these last 2 months: </p>
            <p>* <b>Dept of Finance</b> explained key concepts underpinning 'Financial Literacy in Ireland:  Evidence base for a national strategy' & associated action plan to be devloped later this year</p>
            <p>* <b>Carlow CCDP:</b>  key insights into 'whole-of'community' digital and financial literacy challenges</p>
            <p>* <b>Sen Pat Casey:</b>  Explained how, during 2024, he toured his constituency equipped with an Excel spreadsheet and a forensic understanding of the 3 homebuying schemes and how they might be combined </p>
            <p>* <b>Sorcha Mulligan</b>, mentor and Venture Partner, tech and people enabler</p>
            <p>* <b>Susan Hayes Culleton</b>:  Shared her observations of promoting youth & female financial literacy across 3 continents</p>
            <p>* <b>Leena Kaloinen</b> who activated her network of female financially astute friends to highlight their top concerns</p>
            <p>* <b>Caitlin Hafer</b> of Hedgehog financial who provided 'at the front' insights from her financial app </p>
            <p>* <b>Techstars Weekend Startup Women</b> organisers, mentors and judges</p>
            <p>* <b>Rethink Ireland</b>, for a place on the Social Entrepreneur programme 2024</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This is an ever-growing list, we absolutely welcome any feedback or suggestions at this point.  We are considering which features might add value within FLIT:  discussion is much cheaper than software/ content development! </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Feel free to ask difficult questions.  I've found that putting an idea out there and letting it get a good kicking, leads to workable solutions with a strong story.</p>

            <p>Tuesday was a good-news day.  I received word that my local enterprise office (LEO) will part-fund a FLIT feasibility study.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This works on a matched-funding basis, where I pay upfront, and once the feasibility study is completed, I can reclaim half the costs under authorised categories.</p>
            <p>I aimed high with the costings, and didn't get everything I'd asked for, but it feels like validation and support.</p>
            <p>One key recommendation is to produce a marketing report.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Other activities planned for feasibility study are:</p>
            <p>* Identify stakeholders:  people who would use FLIT, who would pay for FLIT, who would benefit from FLIT's existence.</p>
            <p>* Craft detailed customer persona(s) for site users - narrow reach which can later broaden.  </p>
            <p>* What features are valuable to customers - would financial guidance targeted by lifestage/ decision point be useful?
              Maybe the ability to create & track personalised task lists?  Simplifying processes which require several visits to public websites? 
              A financial healthcheck?  Money-confidence building tools?  A fraud-recognition game?</p>
            <p>* Develop FLIT V1 based on the above</p>

            <p>FLIT.ie attended the pre-natal ward at Techstars Weekend Startup Women 2024.</p>
            <p>This is a mini-accelerator(?) where bright spark entrepreneurs pitch an idea on Friday evening, and form a team of 4-7 people to shape the idea, with intense mentoring and masterclasses provided by TechStars, over the 48-hour period. </p>
            <p>I brought my rickety MVP and concept to this group, and emerged with a well-formed FLIT business concept, clearly aligned with the SDG goals.</p>
            <p>Subjecting an idea to intense scrutiny (particularly when the founder proposes a non-profit-extracting model) meant that FLIT was not only born, it was baptised (in fire).</p>
            <p>The weekend culminated with a competitve pitch; in a wonderful communion of minds, the judges awarded FLIT 2nd place. </p>
            <p>All that remains is to confirm FLIT via a feasibility study.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>The experience and prizes opened doors for FLIT:</b></p>
            <p>* One months co-working space in the Guinnesss Enterprise Centre, led to meeting with Enterprise Ireland & DCC LEO, which in turn led to meeting with The Positive Economist, Susan Hayes Culleton, and joining the Fundr community</p>
            <p>* A ticket to Dublin Tech Summit</p>
            <p>* Tickets to SaaStock, Nov 2024</p>
