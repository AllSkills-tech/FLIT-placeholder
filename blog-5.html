            <h4>Society and technology are changing rapidly</h4>  
             <p>This may equalise women's workforce participation and income over their working lives.  
              New supports such as auto-enrolled defined-contribution pensions move control back to the individual.
              Supports such as grant schemes, social welfare schemes, are available at key lifestages if you are proactive in applying. 
              Active decision-making is to protect oneself or gain the best financial outcomes.  </p>
